# Netflix-1990s-Movie-Analysis-Python-EDA-Project-
This project performs exploratory data analysis on Netflix movie data to understand patterns in film duration and genre trends during the 1990s decade. Using Python (pandas + matplotlib), we filter, analyze, and visualize movie attributes to support a production company researching nostalgic 90s film styles.
